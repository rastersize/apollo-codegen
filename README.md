# Apollo GraphQL Swift Codegen CLI

This is a fork of the official [Apollo GraphQL Swift-based _template_](https://github.com/apollographql/iOSCodegenTemplate).

The (big) **difference between the two** is that **this fork doesnâ€™t require any code changes to run.** Instead options are provided on the commandline to the program. The official repo requires developers to fork and edit the source code to work.

## Version compatibility

**Important:** the version of the CLI **MUST** match the runtime library version used by the app. That is, if the app depends on version 0.42.0 of the Apollo GraphQL library then you must also use version 0.42.0 of the CLI.
